        <h2>What is Importing and Exporting in React?</h2>
        <p>
          In React, importing and exporting components refer to the process of
          sharing and using components across different files in your
          application. JavaScriptâ€™s import and export syntax allows you to bring
          in functions, objects, and components from one file into another,
          creating a modular and maintainable codebase.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Exporting a component means making it available for use in other
            files.
          </li>
          <li>
            Importing a component means bringing it into another file to use it.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

        <h3>Types of Exports in React</h3>
        <p>There are two types of Export and Import</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Default Exports and Imports - A default export allows you to export
            a single component or variable from a file. When importing a default
            export, you can give it any name you choose.{" "}
          </li>
          <li>
            Named Exports and Imports - Named exports allow you to export
            multiple components or variables from a single file. When importing
            a named export, you must use the exact name of the exported entity.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>When to Use Default Export</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Use for a single primary functionality or component in a file.
          </li>
          <li>When you want flexibility in naming during import.</li>
          <li>
            Ideal for components or modules that represent the main purpose of
            the file
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>When to Use Named Export</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
          Use when exporting multiple functionalities or components from the same file.
          </li>
          <li>When you want consistency in import names.</li>
          <li>
          Useful for utility functions, constants, or multiple related components.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

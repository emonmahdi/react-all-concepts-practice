  },
  {
    question: "Difference between props and state?",

      "Props are read-only data passed from parent â†’ child. State is mutable and managed inside a component.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens when you update state?",
    answer:
      "React schedules a re-render of the component with updated state.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you update state directly?",
    answer:
      "No. You must use the state updater function (e.g., setState).",
  },
  {
    question: "What is event handling in React?",
    answer:
      "Handling DOM events using camelCase attributes like onClick, onChange.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is conditional rendering?",

  },
  {
    question: "Difference between controlled and uncontrolled components?",
    answer:
      "Controlled â†’ React manages form state. Uncontrolled â†’ DOM manages form state via refs.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you use multiple states in one component?",
    answer:
      "Yes, you can call useState multiple times in a single component.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the best practice for updating state based on previous state?",
    answer: "Use a callback: setCount((prev) => prev + 1);",
  },
  {
    question: "Can we pass functions as props?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Example: Passing an onClick function to a child button component.",
